	<p>The Global Style<br>by Jeffrey Keedy</p>
Self-initiated work has existed as long as designers have been designing but once a designer shows it to anyone else it is self-promotion. Keep it to yourself and it will remain a private disappointment or point of pride, only you can say. Self-initiated self-promotion is useful, even essential for some, but to what end are you promoting yourself? To demonstrate a set of skills, a style, intellectual acuity, a political or social ideology? Are you looking for work, community, or attention? It is increasingly unclear why some design work is done at all and who it is for.

So called “speculative design” or “critical design” are in reality institutional projects that have little use or interest outside of the institutions that generate them. Whilst this <span>crit room</span> fodder can have a lot of pedagogical value in school, it is a mistake to presume as the fine artist does, that your particular brand of self-indulgent navel-gazing is something the rest of the world needs or wants. Ironically the lack of

	Mr. Keedy talks about the “<span>real world</span>” as if he knows something about it. Maybe he does, but we cannot be sure because he’s not very specific about it – or, not as specific as when he describes the Global Style. In the interview as well as in the original essay, he’s attacking the same tiny tip of the iceberg as the ones celebrated – sometimes “ironically” – by so many others. He’s quite tight-lipped about what graphic designers can actually do in the “real world” instead of the “<span>speculative</span>” world of cultural institutions. A rare, if not the only, concrete suggestion I can find is that a designer may do better in this century as an “entrepreneurial, collaborative, nomadic, polymorphic, practice.” But without any further evidences present, I can only say that it’s, well, speculative.

any criteria for “<span>speculative</span>” or “critical” design makes critical evaluation impossible. It doesn’t have to do anything (outside of the classroom). Your fantasy praxis is the residue of privilege. Obviously if the work is brilliant, beautiful or interesting, that is reason enough for it to exist – but mostly it’s just dumb and boring.</div>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don’t think the way forward is to dump clients and follow your bliss unless you’re rich or retired. The future, like the past, is in the <span>real world</span>, with real projects, self-initiated as well as by commission. Make the world you actually live in not the world you can imagine living in, a little bit better.

Mr. Keedy’s arguments may be useful in a <span>crit room</span>, not so much elsewhere. And not even so in *my* crit room, where it’s already teeming with all the problems, anxieties and desires of the “real world.” Whether they want it or not, most of my students won’t make a “Risograph art catalog or silk-screened poster… for a friend’s ‘art’ show” anyway, because they cannot afford non-paying projects, or don’t have access to a Riso printer, or don't have an artist friend. Mr. Keedy need not worry too much, if his vision is truly global.

 An entrepreneurial, collaborative, nomadic, polymorphic, practice seems to be what will work best in the 21st century. Designers can shape their practice any way they choose. Make good choices.
