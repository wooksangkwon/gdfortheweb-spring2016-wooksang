<h3>O'Say Can you See</h3>
<h4>Two-channel digital video, colr, sound<h4>
<h5>Poitras's installation O'say Can You See consists of a<br>
	double video projection on a two-sided screen. One side<br>
	presents a short film depicting slow-motino shots of<br>
	people gazing at the unseen remains of the World Trade<br>
	Center in the days following the 9/11 attacks. (Also<br>
	titled O'Say Can You See, it was originally shown in 2011<br>
	and is the only aspect of works on view that was not made<br>
	specifically for this exhibition.) Their shocked, mouring<br>
	faces prompt us to meditate on the scene that we know is<br>
	before them. Over these visuals plays a haunting audio<br>
	track: the national anthem, altered and looped by Poitras,<br>
	as it was performed at New York's Yankee Stadium<br>
	During Game Four of the 2001 World Series on October 31,<br>
	2001. The other side of the screen presents U.S. military<br>
	video of the interrogations of two prisoners in Afghanistan,<br>
	also taking place in the months immediately following<br>
	the 9/11 attacks. The prisoners are Said Boujaadia and Salim<br>
	Hamdan, both of whom were subsequently transferred to <br>
	Guantanamo. Poitras detailed the trial of Hamdan, who had<br>
	been Osama bin Laden's driver, in her 2010 film The Oath.<br>
