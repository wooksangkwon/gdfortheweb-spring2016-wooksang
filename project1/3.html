<h3>Bed Down Location, 2016</h3>
<h4>Mixed-media installation with digital color video, 3D sound<br>design, infrared camera, and closed-circuit video<h4>
<h5>Bed Down Location is a projection of the night skies over<br>
	Yemen, Somalia, and Pakistan-contries where the U.S.<br>
	military conducts "targeted killings" using unmanned aircraft.<br>
	The work also includes footage from Creech Air Force<br>
	Base in Nevada, where the military tests and flies drones.<br>
	The video is shown on the ceiling of the gallery space,<br>
	and a reaised platform invites visitors to lay back and gaze at<br>
	the skies where the drone wars are conducted<br>
	<br>
	The 3D sound design layers audio from the sound of<br>
	drones flying, voices of drone pilots, and recordings of radio<br>
	noise heard at the edge of the universe, a reference to<br>
	the title of the exhibition, Astron Noise. The title of the work<br>
	refers to the military term denoting where a targeted<br>
	person sleeps.<br>
	<br>
	The exhibition returns to Bed Down Location in its<br>
	final room, with the streaming data on view functioning as<br>
	an anxious reminder that surveillance has become<br>
	unbiquitous. Whether in the context of the war on terror<br>
	or the everyday use of social-media platforms, one's actions<br>
	are increasingly monitored and transformed into data<br>
	by governmental and corporate interests, the use of which<br>
	is rarely transparent.<br>
