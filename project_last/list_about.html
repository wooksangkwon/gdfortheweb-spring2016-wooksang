<h4>
	The Fletcher building began its new life in late 1998 as studios for graduate students at RISD. Each of the six floors has studios for painting, printmaking and sculpture with shared wood shops and critique space. New media and design students use the adjacent Mason building – the Center for Integrative Technologies – by accessing it through new connecting stairwells between the buildings.

	While the interior renovations went quickly, and reused the old doors and windows that looked into the hallways, the exterior remodelling took more time, and was completed in late 2004. Ground floor retail again occupies the space, with Gourmet Heaven, which opened in 2009 and a selection of bars along Union Street.<br>
