<h3>Selections from the ANARCHIST series, 2016</h3>
<h4>Pigmented inkjet prints mounted on aluminum<h4>
<h5>ANARCHIST is a series of images that the artist has drawn<br>
	from the documnets provided to her by Edward Snowden.<br>
	They display signals collected through an eponymous<br>
	top-secret operation run by the Government Communications<br>
	Headquarters(GCHQ), the United Kingdom's surveillance<br>
	agency. From the top of the Troodos Mountains on the<br>
	island nation of Cyprus, two antennae operating twenty-four<br>
	hours a day intercept signals from satellites, drones, and<br>
	radars in the Mediterranean region.<br>
	<br>
	The images in ANARHCHIST show various stages in the<br>
	process of descrambling the collected signals.<br>
